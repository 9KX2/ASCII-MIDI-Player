Hello! If you are reading this, thanks for using this program!!

**Requirements for the program:**
- Install PIP for python using Command Prompt. (install Python from Microsoft Store)
- MIDO package - use PIP to install it in Command Prompt.
- pygame package - same thing for using PIP to install it. (USE COMMAND PROMPT ASWELL)
- Overall the command to use in command prompt is: **pip install pygame mido python-rtmidi**

**GUIDE:** 
To insert a .mid file for the ASCII-simulated piano script, download ANY .mid file first.
After your done downloading the file, put it into a folder named "midis" that is also located in this MIDI-player folder.
The piano script will also ask you to select which MIDI to play from the folder, select ONLY a number.

If you want to execute the script, press right mouse-click when in the ASCII_MIDI-Player folder in File Explorer,
It will show you to "Open in Terminal", you press to open it in the Terminal.
All you need to do is type in terminal this command: "python ascii_piano.py" and you got the program working, congrats.
